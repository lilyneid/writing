## Blackjack Sabbath
I think I knew you again in the evening glow<br>
when you spilled your last hand of cards<br>
into the soft flesh of my palm. You whistled,<br>
like you did before, when times were good<br>
and I wasn’t thinking so often about death.<br>
Truly, I don’t anymore, except to close her door<br>

hard behind me. Nothing comes through that door<br>
that I care to deal with. You practically glow<br>
with nervous rage, a light I saw at my death,<br>
real death, the type of death they don’t write cards<br>
about. The type of death they say “Finally, good<br>
riddance” about. Your fist often whistled<br>

through the air when you saw me. I whistled<br>
a new tune out of the rich air. I made your door<br>
my new home base, knew you’d lock me out for good<br>
if I couldn’t find a way to make your cheeks glow<br>
with rage or love or both. We deal the cards<br>
we are given, and I dealt the card of death.<br>

You didn’t like that. When I planned my death<br>
you wondered why I skipped and whistled.<br>
I was weightless. I’m heavy now. Your hand cards<br>
through my hair, and I think of that old red door<br>
that used to lead into my house. Sunset glow<br>
could barely crawl beneath the cracks. It was good<br>

enough for me then. I can’t imagine it would be good<br>
enough for me now. That’s the thing about death,<br>
it makes you appreciate that sunset glow.<br>
Last night I saw the sun was setting and I whistled<br>
to you, a dog-sharp sound, right from your door<br>
and invited you out for drinks and a game of cards.<br>

I think you got me when I first saw those cards<br>
dealt from your hands like weapons. You’re good<br>
and you know it, sending cheating men to the door,<br>
but you always let me stick around. Maybe death<br>
was necessary, but as your laughter whistled<br>
‘round the room, I felt my soul stir, maybe glow.<br>

I closed that door behind me, because death<br>
is nothing but a game of cards. Games are good<br>
fun, a little bird once whistled. But I want that glow.<br>
