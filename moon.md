## How to Run Away to The Moon
1. Determine your reason. You’re stuck in your room, it’s midnight, and you are terminally, astronomically bored. You’ll have to go to bed soon, of course, even though school isn’t yet in session, because you like to actually get a good night’s sleep.

Outside the door, your parents dwell, and you feel a special dread build at the idea of it, even though they’re definitely sound asleep at the moment. Yeah. You think you have a pretty good reason to go to the moon.

2. Gather your materials (and your resolve). You will need more than just hope and a dream. If you want to go somewhere else, you’ve got to put in a solid amount of effort. That’s what everyone always tells you—put in the effort or you’re not going to get anything out of it. 

3. Find the closest (time wise) full moon. You have to plot it down to the very second. Or don’t. You can use an online calculator for this step.

4. Think about what to do next. Your master plan needs a master amount of thought behind it, after all, and there’s no way you’re getting somewhere else without the expert mind of an extraordinary thinker. You know you’re just spitballing metaphors right now, or whatever it is you mean by “escaping to the moon”, but even if you can’t literally go there, you want to mentally bring yourself there. Or something. 

5. Draw a map from the full moon to your house. Try and make it pretty. Or at least passable. You scribble it on some leftover paper from a science class three years ago.

6. Don’t do the previous step. Scrap absolutely everything about the previous step, it’s a dumb idea and won’t get you anywhere. Why did you do that and waste all your time? Of course you can’t go to the moon. What use would a stupid little map do you? This is stupid, it’s all so fucking stupid. You’ve never been a rational kid, always been the type to dream of better places, but these four tiny walls must be driving you crazy because you never do idiotic things like this. You like to keep yourself in check. It’s hopeless. No one is coming to get you. You’re never getting out.

7. Calm down. Okay, it might be stupid, but it’s not that stupid. No need to get in a tizzy over it. People do stupid stuff all the time—that’s why you’re here. 

8. Throw it out. The scrunched-up paper slowly unravels a bit as it sits there, like it was just waiting for you to let go so it could mock you. You know that’s not what it’s doing, you’re not stupid, but it’s starting to feel like even the paper thinks you’re useless.

9. Get up and put it in properly this time. Your feet drag on the carpet, too-thick synthetic stuff, an absolute pain on your skin without the protective layer of a warm cotton sock. People had come to install it before you moved in, laid down cheap fibers over the rock of the foundation that all east coast homes need to have, and you’d ached at the thought of the dirt choking beneath it. You’d live on the level of the grass if you could, step around the little pockets of daisies that pop up when summer comes around, not wear shoes so you don’t grind the plants too far into the ground with their weight, live without a roof under the pure light of the night sky. You don’t miss the second time you drop the paper in the bin.

10. Figure out what to do next. The moon idea is good. It must be so freeing to live on the moon. That’s what you thought when you picked the moon as your guiding light for your escape journey. Gravity never seemed to be a necessity to you, always felt like a chain. There aren’t any rooms on the moon, no places you have to lock yourself in to get away from screaming mothers. The moon would be a good mother, in your humble opinion, a good enough mother that you wouldn’t even need a dad beside her, you could just have the moon. She would be gentle and soft and kind, and she wouldn’t be mean to you when you said something stupid or your grades weren’t perfect. If she had arms, she’d hold you all the time. You know there are moon goddesses, told in tales across the world, but you don’t think there’s anything better than the round sight of her in the sky, solid and real in a way stories aren’t.

You don’t really know what to do. 

11. Do something anyway. You take a couple of trinkets into your hands and throw them out. The guilt hits in after just a moment. You fish them out and put them back in their place—a pair of little action figures from a fast food meal you got when you were much younger and much stupider. There’s no use in throwing out the little things you like. It always makes you feel bad.

You go back to your bed, sitting up this time, legs tied in a criss-cross and hands sitting nicely in your lap. Your mind goes back to kindergarten when the teachers would sit you down in a row and have you arrange your legs in knots. The whole ordeal reminded you of church, although you hadn’t been for a while at that point, and can’t remember what they feel like today. You still haven’t done anything.

12. Think about why (again). You want to get out, to be free. You can’t walk out the bedroom door and you know it, because the door hides fear and disappointment and parents. Your parents aren’t bad, they really aren’t that bad; they can be harsh on grade day, but you understand that, because you’ve never been the smartest kid in the world. They try to be kind. They care, you know they care. They were raised in the north, and the cold seems to have made them colder. 

Your fingers come to a bruise on your knee, red and purple and all sorts of ugly, gently pressing just to feel that it’s real. Somewhere inside of you, you know something is wrong. Good parents do not knock their kids to their knees with the force of a hit. And yet you can’t find it in yourself to blame them, because you know they love you. But you’re not stupid, not that stupid, and that’s why the door is not an option. You don’t want to be any closer to them tonight.

13. Look out the window. You scoot over to your window by the bed and push back the curtains to stare up at the glittering night sky in all it’s magnitude. The moon shines bright tonight, sitting nicely above the tree line like the crown of Mother Nature herself. There aren’t many stars out, the curse of a light-polluted suburbia, but there’s this. There’s not much street lamps can do to put out a mirror of the Sun, although thinking of her like that makes your stomach twist in a strange way. It doesn’t feel right.

14. Open the window. A rush of cool night air hits your cheeks as you unlatch the lock and lift the bottom section up by the handle on the bottom. It’s not much of a wind, but it’s enough to stir the hairs on your shoulders, lift them up in an imitation of the moon’s gravity. 

14. Climb onto the roof. It’s not easy to drag your gangly body out of your room and through the open mouth of the window, but you manage. Slowly, you let the coolness of the atmosphere calm you as the gentle wind picks up again, lightly tossing your clothes against your skin between gusts. You give yourself one more moment to breathe, in and out, deeply—the air in your room didn’t feel so fresh, so alive. Your eyes lock onto the shining lantern of the moon.

15. Stay there. You just sit there, looking up. The world looks so much realer without glass in the way. 

You can feel it all, hear it, know the dance of the atmosphere against your skin and the melody of bugs in the trees. Everything is so much realer than the little bed in your room. You almost want to go back in but you don’t. You don’t.

16. Close your eyes. 

17. Breathe in. You take a big breath in, filling your lungs with the moonlight and all it’s gentle glow. You feel fuller, happier, a bit freer than you did before, because nothing can get you if you’ve got stardust inside of you and you’re sitting on the roof with your face turned towards the sky. 

18. Breathe out. The breath escapes your lips and your lungs with ease, like problems blowing away. You feel a bit calmer. You’re going to have to go back inside, eventually. You’re just so happy to be out of that room.

19. Climb back in, go to bed, and prepare to go on another day. But not yet. For now, you’ll sit out here among the crisp air, not caring for the time or the mess in your room, and you will watch the moon grow.

20. Congratulations. You finished the first step.
