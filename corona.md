# “A dark grey corona”: Disco Elysium and the Deconstruction of Identity
## Abstract
Disco Elysium deconstructs identity as we understand it. Whether that be personal identity, national identity, or the identity of the game and genre itself, Disco Elysium does not allow itself or its contents to be neatly categorized. By resisting commonly held ideas of the player, we are forced into a viewpoint that emphasizes the interconnectedness and complexity of all reality. Through a synthesis of the Gothic presented in Disco Elysium as Gothic fiction by J. Novitz, Jonne Arjoranta’s work on game hermeneutics, and the various explorations of narrative multiplicity in Disco Elysium, this paper will explain how Disco Elysium leverages a mass of unsolidity (the world of the Pale, the non-place) against the grounded yet shaken world of people, places, and things in Elysium. The world of Disco Elysium, Elysium, is steeped in history and identities as they merge into each other, with seemingly clear-cut boundaries between them falling apart with further scrutiny. In other words, Disco Elysium is a portrait of our world that proposes a radically decentered identity through rigorously challenging the player in narrative and gameplay alike. In such a world divided and violent against itself, Disco Elysium provides a much-needed deconstruction of common assumptions of identity that is lacking today in much modern ideological discourse. Through analyzing the world of Disco Elysium, we catch a glimpse of a world much like ours – a beautiful and broken place that aches to be understood – and through the experiences of our avatar Harrier "Harry" Du Bois, we get an idea of how to move forward.

## Introduction
Disco Elysium: The Final Cut (ZA/UM, 2022), henceforth referred to as Disco Elysium, is a classic roleplaying game (cRPG) that describes itself as a “detective RPG”. Released on March 30th, 2021, it was met with critical acclaim and a dedicated fanbase, quickly gaining renown as a masterpiece of interactive media. Disco Elysium currently as of this writing stands at a rating of 97 out of 100 in the PC section of games on Metacritic, making it the highest ranked PC game in the history of the site (Metacritic, 2023). 

Written and directed by the Estonian Robert Kurvitz, Disco Elysium takes inspiration from the world of Eastern Europe, as well as the pre-Soviet and pre-Cold War eras. A heavy amount of the literature surrounding Disco Elysium has come from academics based in Eastern Europe, and much been published in journals such as the Baltic Screen Media Review. Despite the heavy Eastern European influence, Disco Elysium has become a worldwide cult favorite due to its complex political themes, intricate storytelling, and refusal to shy away from dark themes. The commentary of Disco Elysium has become the subject of great discourse among fans, with online discussions analyzing the world and characters being commonplace.

However, even though the game has been received incredibly well, there is a lack of academic discussion about many of its themes, including that of the way identity itself is handled. Identity is, as one might expect, a core part of RPGs, and Disco Elysium does not shy away from handling it. Just as the text analyzes and deconstructs other aspects of its story, Disco Elysium addresses the concept of identity and self head-on, discussing the identity of the avatar, the identity of the world, and the identity of the genre. Each is addressed in its own unique way, each linked with each other to create a whole discourse of self.

## Identity of Digital Literature
Before discussing the content of Disco Elysium itself, it's worth delving into the context of the medium of electronic literature. Spanning several types of creations, from the more literary interactive fiction to the more ludic form of the RPG, electronic literature employs a combination of techniques from traditional literature and digital media. Referred to as a "child" of these types of media and also as a devalued "monster", electronic literature is a somewhat neglected form of storytelling in the world of literary criticism (Pressman, 2019). 

Disco Elysium is more like electronic literature than a video game, although both in themselves are "hybrid genres", as stated before (Ensslin, 2014). Disco Elysium's literary elements take center-stage, but the ludic elements land it solidly in the medium of a video game, just an incredibly literary one. The form of interactive fiction particularly seems to have influenced Disco Elysium. IF itself is a very inventive form, focusing mostly on "character techniques and character complexity, multiple perspectives, or different endings and/or storylines without victory conditions", traits we often find in Disco Elysium as well (Ensslin, 2014). The analysis of electronic literature has been proposed by Katherine Hayles to require both the "specificity of new media without abandoning the rich resources of traditional modes of understanding" (Hayles, 2008).

As such, this paper will take the electronic mode of Disco Elysium as not a circumstance but a necessary addition to the rich web of its storytelling. Disco Elysium could not exist as it does without being both an electronic and a literary medium, and so it is only appropriate to consider the special context of electronic literature and its themes.

## Identity of the Avatar
Our avatar, a man later revealed to be named Harrier “Harry” Du Bois (henceforth referred to as Harry), is introduced to us naked and hungover on the floor of a trashed hotel room. We have no knowledge of how he got here, who he is, what he is doing here, or why the room is in such a state. Neither does he, having lost his memory. Slowly, as the days progress, we learn that he is a decorated detective in a city called Martinaise to solve the murder of a local mercenary. The game progresses as our knowledge of Harry does, and as we begin to know him, we begin to mold him.

The first words we hear in this game, however, are not the voice of another or the voice of Harry himself. Instead, we are met with a deep, hoarse speech, telling us the simple truth of what we perceive – “There is nothing. Only warm, primordial blackness” (ZA/UM, 2022). The voice tells us more, that our consciousness is “fermenting”, that this death is “sweet and endless”, describing a “bloated *man-meat*” in which you both are contained (ZA/UM, 2022). This voice we are greeted with is one of Harry’s internal voices, a deeply hidden and terrifying part that we only encounter when Harry is unconscious.

Immediately after, we are awoken by the first of what we will soon learn is twenty-four “skills”, all speaking with the same internal voice but with wildly different personalities. Our skills offer Harry advice and comfort, as well as antagonize him from within. They function narratively as if they were entirely different characters, much akin to the trope of the angel and devil over one’s shoulder.
The game opening to a black screen, being greeted with an autonomous internal voice, and soon meeting the many parts of Harry’s internal consciousness is an immediate and nearly frightening departure from the concept of solid self that many are familiar with. We are given “a sense of a fractured and unbalanced mindset” reminiscent of Gothic literature rather than that of roleplaying games (Novitz, 2021). Already, both the genre and the self have been called into question. 

There’s an added dimension in that the distinctions between skills are, to put it lightly, confusing. One author noted that “the skills do not have discrete and individualized gameplay functions but overlap with one another” (Novitz 2021). Rather than simple angel and devil figures, each skill portrays a complex piece of Harry’s psyche. Each piece is linked together by virtue of sharing the same body, but are also functionally autonomous. One could compare it to the image of a divided council in which members strongly disagree on various ideas.

This doesn’t stop after the opening sequence, of course. The skills stay with the player the entire game, constantly in what can be best described as “competition and conversation” (Novitz, 2021). Rather than starting with an understanding of a whole character, we must help him piece himself together over the course of the game – and even then, he is never truly whole in the sense of his parts being united. He will always be somewhat fractured.
