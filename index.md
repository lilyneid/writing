# A Writing Portfolio

## Biography
Welcome to my writing portfolio! My name is Lily Neidhardt (they/them), and here you'll find various writing projects of mine, both academic and creative. I'm currently a master's student at the University of Central Florida with a bachelor's in Creative Writing. My dream is to go further into media criticism while also making my own creative works. 

## Academic Writing

## Poetry

- [i refuse to say the words](refuse): An aubade about the things inside us we can't face quite yet.
- [ANGELA](angela): A poem about old friends and better days.

## Prose
- [IRIS](iris): A short horror story about a young woman, a bad boyfriend, and the mold in the wall.
