## i refuse to say the words
i see you, uncertain,<br>
at the end of the hallway,<br>
out of the corner of my eye.<br> 
the hairs on the back<br>
&nbsp;of my neck rise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;flowers towards that rising sun-<br>

every morning<br>
i see you clearer.<br> 
every dawn i’m awake, jolted;<br>
but there is no terror here,<br>
just the fading warmth of<br> 
my apocalypse.<br>

your word is on my tongue.<br> 
my hands are your hands.<br>
oh, this peace will end, and<br> 
when it does, it will be beautiful.<br>
we will feel every part of me destroyed.<br> 
we will become supernova.<br>
one day we will not be so afraid.<br>

i can’t bring myself to say what you are.<br>
but when i do,<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there will be light.<br>
