There were two of us<br>
in these old woods, once,<br>
dancing between the pines,<br>
â€˜till you found yourself<br>
too tired of it all.<br>
 
The wind blows. I watch<br>
you leave. I will <br>
welcome the spring myself.<br>
But come morning I see you,<br>
at the woods-edge peeking in,<br>
trying to catch a look<br>
at the daisies.<br>
