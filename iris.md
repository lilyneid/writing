## Iris
Her name does not matter. What matters, here, is that she is important to something bigger than herself. What matters is that she is something new.

She lives in a cheap apartment on a decent enough street, the state of the building being what most would call “dilapidated”, but it’s near enough her workplace that she doesn’t pay the condition much mind. Once a month there’s an issue with the plumbing, or some sort of mold crawling up the walls, but that’s a flaw that works in her favor. A messy drain will let the roaches in.

She works at a flower shop, a nice little place down the road filled wall-to-wall with the sickeningly rich smell of potted plants. Her hair, long and black and usually unkempt, will come completely undone at the mercy of the damp air. Secretly, as she passes mirrors, she smiles. Messiness is homely. Messiness is real, like the blooms and the leaves and the scissors with which she cuts them.
As a child, she would sit and stare at the dirt that lines the pavement. Weeds would creep their ways between the cracks of concrete, ants and beetles and worms writhe their own roads across sidewalks and lawns. To her, they were little soldiers, marching to their own battles and drums together, not one separate from the other in a way that means anything at all.

There is a poetry to it all, one that other people can’t quite seem to understand. Plants and their pollinators and the roots that connect them—they are all the parts of one big organism, something bigger than the rest of them by far. She told this to her mother, once, a woman who is now just a memory and blocked number. She just shook her head and laughed. She stopped laughing when she never grew out of it.

Sometimes, when she was younger, people stared. Sometimes, even worse, they talked. They thought she couldn’t see them, whispering out of the corner of her eye at the weird disheveled girl who’s staring bug-eyed into the dirt, but she thinks they shouldn’t be so presumptuous. She wonders if the bugs have gossip, or hatred, in that little land they must live in. She wonders how big everything else must seem.

The boy she loves now is not a kind one. This boy is one of those boys. He comes over at nighttime hours that can better be described as morning, smelling of cigarettes and dollar store aftershave. She never turns him down. She opens the door with a grin and kisses his cheek like it’s her duty. She is always the lady, always the nymph, always the pretty thing that will love until the life has been sucked out of her by some parasitic boy who would rather be drunk on the street. This is not the first boy, and she hopes to God that he will be the last. But she will always let him in.

He brings with him an air of disregard, as if he doesn’t even care for the skin he’s in, let alone the pretty girl with the shaky hands who falls asleep with her head on his shoulder. Contrary to what some may think, she’s not stupid. She knows who he is. She will not admit it, but that’s the very thing that drew her to him in the first place. This is the love that excites her, the love that sends those sparks flying down her spine; she wants a challenge.

She spends most of her days at the shop, dirt packing itself firm beneath her nails and the pollen shaking itself free over her hands, and she comes back to the apartment with an earthly glow. She does not believe this is work as much as it is duty, a compulsion. It is a way she can let the twisting ache of her heart breathe. It feels good to sink her fingers in the wall of stems and run her palms along the tops of the flowers.

She comes home late some nights, from staying back to make sure everything is in order. They depend on her, she feels—the plants depend on her in ways that humans don’t, that humans can’t, so she has to tend to them gently. Her boy usually isn’t over until much later. She doesn’t think much of it at all, until the night he is.

He let himself in. She doesn’t know how and doesn’t really question it, just goes to the fridge for her leftovers. He asks, from his place sat comfortably on her ratty old couch, what she was doing out so late. She answers, talks briefly about what needed to be done at the store, before she feels it bubbling in the back of her throat. She is going to talk about the plants, and tired as she is, unprepared, she does.

She tells him in haunting poetry about the beauty of the plants and the bugs she finds inside them, about the molding infections she finds rotting the flowers from the inside out. She tells him about the way they sing to her, the way they call, the way she wishes she could bury herself inside them and breathe them in so she’ll never be alone again. She tells him so fast her breath leaves her faster than she can bring more in, sending her gasping as she talks.

She comes to in the living room, snapped out of her fugue by his hand on her shoulder, knuckles nearly white with how hard they’ve gripped her. His face is all pinched in worry, a haunted look cast over his eyes.

*It’s real*, she whispers. *They’re right here*.

He moves for the door. It clicks shut behind him. She stands there, motionless for a few minutes, before she can muster up the wherewithal to move.

Her phone has never been something that she’s very attached to, but she spends the next hour hunched over it, pressing the buttons in sequence again and again, letting her call ring out to the tone until she shakes with desperate fear. He is not a kind boy, he has never been a kind boy; he doesn’t pick up. She takes a pillow to her face and screams, buries herself in bed and stares at the patch of mold on the wall. Her heart beats hard in tandem with the fan stirring her blinds against the window. She only sleeps when her eyes become tired.

She wakes, bleary, to the sun already high and a text from her boy. Her shaky fingers scramble to unlock it.

i’m gonna be gone for a couple days. don’t wait up.

She reads it once. Twice. A couple times over, again, she reads it, unblinking until her eyes grow blurry and tears threaten to fall. She waits for a moment, hoping it will make sense, feel better. It doesn’t. She buries her head back under the covers and wails.

She stays there for a while, peeking her head from under the covers only to glare at the sunlight. She wonders, not for the first time, what it feels like to be part of that other world. She wonders what it feels like to be part of a whole that cannot reject you for your habits, your voice, your spirit. She wonders, and she scratches at her skin until she bleeds.

She can hear something, now, singing to her from the ground. They sing to her from the walls, the sky, the furniture and the wood that was used to build it. Their noiseless song reverberates throughout her skull like an echo in an empty theater.

*What do I do?* she asks them. *What am I supposed to do?*

In return, quietly, she hears a new name.

Her old name is not important. It is what she is to them that matters. It is the most beautiful thing she has ever heard.

A few days later, he texts her again. He’s asking to meet up at her house. She readily accepts with a calm heart. There is nothing he can take from her now, after all—why would she be scared of him? He held her heart in his palm before, but now? They schedule it easily, and when the time comes, she lets him in with a smile.

He seems surprised to see her so calm and gentle. Her hands do not shake when she casually brings up the water damage beneath the sink. There’s mold growing. He starts to look afraid. He moves to leave, again, but with strength that she’d never had before, she corners him, shoves his ear to the wall. He cries out, maybe in pain, maybe in fear. She doesn’t know. It’s not the type of thing that matters.

Her name was never important before, but now it is. She is something new, she is the eye through which they watch. He has to understand.

*Listen*, she demands. *You’ll hear it.*

He sputters, panicking, strains against her arms. She holds him tight to the ground.

*There’s something here. There’s something here. It’s talking. You can hear it. Just listen. You can hear it.*

Listen, *Harley.*

Their names didn’t matter before. But now? Oh, now.

His fingers stop clawing at the wallpaper, tips bloodied with the desperate force he’d been using to try and push himself away. He falls limp. His eyes go wide. *Oh. Oh, no.*

With a wide smile, Iris begins to laugh.
